# Security Policy

This policy applies only to the SocialShareButton repository.

## Supported Versions

The latest version available on the `main` branch is actively maintained and supported with security updates.  
Older versions may not receive security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, report it privately using GitHub’s built-in private vulnerability reporting feature:

https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/SocialShareButton/security/advisories/new

Private reporting ensures the issue can be addressed responsibly without exposing users to unnecessary risk.

If private reporting is unavailable, please contact the repository maintainers through the organization’s official communication channels.

## What to Include in Your Report

To help us investigate efficiently, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- The potential impact and affected components
- Any proof-of-concept code, logs, or screenshots (if applicable)
- Suggested mitigation or fix (if known)

Providing detailed information helps us respond more quickly and effectively.

## Response and Disclosure Process

Once a vulnerability report is received:

1. The maintainers will acknowledge receipt of the report within 48 hours.
2. The issue will be investigated and validated.
3. If confirmed, a fix will be developed and tested.
4. We will coordinate responsible disclosure with the reporter.
5. A security update or patch will be released as soon as possible.

We kindly ask reporters to avoid public disclosure until a fix has been released, allowing us to protect users effectively.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and thank you for helping keep SocialShareButton secure and reliable.
